# HTTP Web Server (C)

This project implements a basic HTTP web server using raw TCP sockets in C.

It listens on a port, accepts client connections, parses HTTP requests,
and serves responses back to the browser.

Features:
- Socket-based networking
- HTTP request parsing
- Multiple client handling
- Static file serving

Built in C as part of a systems programming course.
All networking and request-handling logic was written by me.

What I learned:
- TCP/IP sockets
- HTTP protocol
- Concurrent server design
- Low-level debugging
